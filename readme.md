# Classroom Timer
A web-based timer for classrooms. May not be accurate or up-to-date.

## Features
- Display the current time, current/next subject, how much time is left before the next class/recess/end of all classes and<del>, most importantly,</del> today's lunch menu. You have to manually set the URL to fetch the menu from before the lunch menu can be displayed.
- Play sound some time before the class/recess starts. Unfortunately, no sound is included; you have to insert your own.

## TODO
- Replace unreadable constant arrays with local file I/O.
- Put the sound and background files back.
